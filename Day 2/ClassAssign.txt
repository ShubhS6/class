Advantages of Spiral model
1. One of the key advantages of the Spiral Model is its focus on risk management. 
2. The Spiral Model is highly flexible and allows for iterative development

Disadvantages of spiral model
1. It is more complex 
2. it is time consuming
3. with the iteration increase the cost is also increase.
4. it is not good for small project.

Advantages of V model--
1. It is use for small project.
2. Simple and easy to understand and use.
3. it focus on verification and validation activities early in the lyfe cycle thats why
   it create error free and good quality product.

Disadvantages of V model--
1. High risk and uncertainty.
2. It is not good for complex and oops project.
3. it is not suitable for projects where requirements are not clear and risk of changing.
4. It is time Consuming.

Agile--
The agile model refers to the iterative approach to delivering a software product. This means that instead of delivering a large project only when all parts are complete, 
	a team breaks down a large project into smaller parts, and delivers these completed smaller parts in regular cycles. For example, using the agile model a developer delivers multiple releases of a product 
	and each release could add a single feature, such as drop-down menus, checkboxes, or multiple-choice buttons. The final release would contain all features.

The agile model is typically used in software development, where, as technology rapidly changes, extensive collaboration is needed and 
	continuous delivery and iterative change are expected. The agile model focuses on implementing small changes over a short cycle.
