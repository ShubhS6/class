Assignment on PDCP layer

sequence number
header Compression
integrity Protection
ciphering


it is based on Rohc it is protocol to compress the header
ip packet is of size 40 byte dont consider much usefull

#include <iostream>

class PDCP {
private:
    int sequenceNumber;  // Sequence number counter

public:
    PDCP() : sequenceNumber(0) {}  // Constructor to initialize sequence number
    
    // Method to get the next sequence number
    int getNextSequenceNumber() {
        return sequenceNumber++;
    }
};

int main() {
    PDCP pdcpInstance;

    // Simulate sending packets with sequence numbers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        int sequenceNumber = pdcpInstance.getNextSequenceNumber();
        std::cout << "Sending packet with sequence number: " << sequenceNumber << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
